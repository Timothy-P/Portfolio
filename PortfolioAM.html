                Hello, my name is Timothy Poynter and I have been interested in <br>programming since the 5th grade.
                I started with Micro:Bit <br> and then progressed to learning HTML, CSS, and JS.<br><br>
                Currently, I am using my knowledge of HTML, JS, and CSS to create my portfolio. <br> However, I have faced some challenges in school where some people have mistaken my programming work for hacking.<br> Although it can be frustrating at times, I try to ignore these misconceptions as it is a small part of the overall experience of programming.
