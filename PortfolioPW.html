                I have completed several projects that have demonstrated <br> my progress in programming. <br>
                Every project, including the files that hold code for future reference, has a unique story.<br>
                Among my projects are a scientific calculator (my most advanced work to date), a timer, a schedule for my classes, and a clock that displays both military and civilian time (AM and PM).<br>
                I intend to upload all of these projects, organized to the best of my ability, to multiple repositories or a single repository in the future.
