                I enjoy Programming (duh) and gaming. I like to play more fast pace games like Titanfall 2.<br>
                I've played countless hours on Borderlands 2, but I have gotten burnt out on it. <br>
                Programming is a hobbie for me, and I'll do it during my classes or at home. Most of the time, it'll be during class because I have a lot down time due to how quickly I can finish the work without making no if not any mistakes.
