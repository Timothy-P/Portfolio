# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my skills (at the moment).
I'm always improving, so it'll take a while before I'm fully content with what I have made.
I'll probably make several .html files before I am finished, so make sure you click the right one (I'll probably put it somewhere in here).

The home file: Portfolio.html (of course)

# Latest changes:

-Deleted Portfolio.js

-Finished (probably) the project

-Enjoy! :)
