# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my skills (at the moment).
I'm always improving, so it'll take a while before I'm fully content with what I have made.
I'll probably make several .html files before I am finished, so make sure you click the right one (I'll probably put it somewhere in here).

Latest changes:
-Made "Previous works" page
-Worked on the CSS to change the font to something more formal
-Changes to the "About Me" page to improve what is said
-Removed button from home page.
