# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my skills (at the moment).
I'm always improving, so it'll take a while before I'm fully content with what I have made.
I'll probably make several .html files before I am finished, so make sure you click the right one (I'll probably put it somewhere in here).

# Latest changes:

-Created and finished sections of the page

-Working on the Interests page

-Contact Info page finished (mostly)
